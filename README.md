<h1>Visualization of Camera Calibration</h1>
<p>
	The program is designed to process the calibration data got as a result of camera calibration, visualize the position and orientation of the cameras in the space, and provide interactive exploration of the scene. To provide intuition of the space the global coordinate axis are rendered and x-z plane of the global coordinate system is rendered as grid. User can change the view point position and orientation as well as adjust the ground plane regarding the cameras and store the modified calibration data.
